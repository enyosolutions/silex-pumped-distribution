## BASE PROJECT

lyrixx project is a great way to start working on silex with a proper structure.
It features
- Directory structure
- MVCish approach
- Doctrine DBAL
- Translation
- Bootstrap
- Boilerplate


However i wasn't satisfied with some of the choices that where made in the project. So i made some changes :

- Implemented a User management system : [**Simple User for Silex**](https://github.com/jasongrimes/silex-simpleuser).
- Implemented a proper mvc folder structure in the the "src/" directory
- Created controllers system as services [** See Silex services controllers **](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/service_controller.html).
- Moved non specific elements to the folder "resources/"
- Moved the twig templates to "src/"
- Updated the layout using the SimpleUser version
- Styled the css using the spacelab sheet from [** Bootswatch**](http://bootswatch.com)
